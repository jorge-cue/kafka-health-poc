# Kafka Health Proof of Concept

## Introduction

The concept to test with this project is to try to enable the monitoring of the Kafka connections (listeners and producers) and use it to respond to readiness and liveness probes on Kubernetes (K8s).

### Results so far

So far I am not able to detect when Kafka becomes unavailable neither for listeners nor producers.
But we can detect for kafka presence and availability on the livenessProbe, please see class HealthControlPanel for the solution.

## How to run the tests

### Step 1: Get Kafka in your local machine

[Download](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/2.7.0/kafka_2.13-2.7.0.tgz]) the latest Kafka release and extract it:
```
tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.7.0.tgz
cd kafka_2.13-2.7.0
```

### Step 2: Start the Kafka environment

Note: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.

Open a terminal and run the following commands to start zookeeper.
```
cd (to the directory where you installed Kafka on Step 1)
bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
```

Then open a second terminal and run the following commands to start kafka.
```
cd (to the directory where you installed Kafka on Step 1)
bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties
```

Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.

### Step 3: Run this application

Now run this application, the application creates the topic if required. Open a third terminal and run the following command.

```
gradle bootRun
```

### Step 4: To send a message though the program using postman

Send an HTTP PUT to the address `http://localhost:8080/send/{{message}}` where `{{message}}` should be replaced by the text (URL encoded) you want to send.

For example `curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/send/Hello%20World`

The service shall respond with an HTTP STATUS 202 (Accepted), and the application should log the following entries:

```
 c.e.k.o.web.KafkaHealthPocProducer       : Success sending message: Hello World
	topic topic-1 partition 0 offset 0 key 4f37d6f5-0a57-4e13-8d94-5797d8f9e030 value Hello World
 c.e.k.i.kafka.KafkaHealthPocListener     : processing record: Hello World	
    topic topic-1 partition 0 offset 0 key 4f37d6f5-0a57-4e13-8d94-5797d8f9e030 value Hello World
```
Fields: partition, offset, and key; will have other values, but the general schema should be the same.

### Step 5: Force and detect Kafka down error

Hit [livenessProve](http://localhost:8080/health/liveness) before stopping Kafka server, must respond with an OK (200) status.

Switch to the terminal where Kafka server is running and stop the server hitting Control-C. The server should stop, and the application should detect some kind of error and report it in the log.

Hit [livenessProve](http://localhost:8080/health/liveness) after stopping Kafka server, must respond with SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503) status with a small delay.

## Liveness Probe

This probe is used to validate that the service is able to compute its result, is defined as livenessProve, when it reports any HTTP STATUS out of the range 200 to 399 the probe will be flagged as failed, depending on configuration parameters K8s if the failure persists K8s will stop the podÂ´s container and relaunch a new container in the same pod, expecting that the condition can be solved with this refresh, giving the pod self-healing ability.  

To run the livenessProbe by hand use the command bellow; the application will respond with an HTTP status in the range 200 to 399 to pass the test, if the service is not available it will respond an HTTP status 503 (service unavailable) or timeout.
```
curl http://localhost:8080/health/liveness
```

## Readiness Probe

This probe is used to validate that the service is able to receive network traffic and is defined as readinessProbe, when it reports any Http status between 200 and 399 the probe is successful, and the pod is enabled to receive network traffic. When the probe reports any status out of the range, or the call to the probe has a timeout, according to parameters in the probe configuration, the pod is marked as non available, and K8s suspends any network traffic to that pod for a while expecting that it becomes stable again, after a waiting time the probe is retried and the process repeats.

To run the readinessProbe by hand use the command bellow; the application will respond with an HTTP status in the range 200 to 399 to pass the test, if the service is not available it will respond an HTTP status 503 (service unavailable) or timeout.
```
curl http://localhost:8080/health/readiness
```
